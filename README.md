OAM (Orbital Angular Momentum) is an advanced communication technology expected to play a big role in next-generation networks beyond 5G and 6G. It aims to achieve incredibly fast data speeds that reach terabit levels.

OAM communication transmits data through radio waves that rotate in a spiral shape. This rate of rotation is defined as the 'OAM mode.' For instance, in OAM mode 1, the phase of the radio wave completes 2pi rotation for every wavelength it advances.

Multiplexing is possible by using different OAM modes. This is how OAM achieves high-speed data transmission.
